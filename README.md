# Dealership Project
This repository is part of a project developed in partnership with @summonsumo and -- in a course using the Databricks platform.


## Architecture
The figure below illustrates in a very simplified way how the communication between the components occurred.
The files used came from an SFTP server where the hypothetical client posted as needed.
After being loaded into Datalake, the Databricks platform was used for cleaning and preparation for consumption.
